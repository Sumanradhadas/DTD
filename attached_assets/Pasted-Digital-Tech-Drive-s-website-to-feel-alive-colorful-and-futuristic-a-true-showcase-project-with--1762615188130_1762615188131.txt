Digital Tech Drive’s website to feel alive, colorful, and futuristic — a true showcase project with AI-powered interactivity and smooth, eye-catching animations everywhere.
That’s exactly the kind of website that makes people go “wow” when they land on it.

Let’s finalize the complete high-end plan before we start creating the first wireframe + code setup.

🌐 FINALIZED PROJECT BLUEPRINT
🚀 Digital Tech Drive – “Empowering Bihar’s Youth for a Digital Future”
🎯 Core Goal

A vibrant, animated, AI-integrated website that helps students discover skill development courses through an interactive AI course selector powered by Gemini API, while beautifully representing the institution’s mission and offerings.

🎨 DESIGN CONCEPT — “Colorful Light Flow”

Think of Google’s style mixed with MKCL’s vibrancy:

Light background (white / soft grey)

Color gradients that move (animated glow borders, rainbow ribbons)

Smooth section transitions (fade-ins, slides, parallax)

AI assistant popup with glowing border and typing animation

Primary Color Palette:

White / Light Grey (#f9f9f9 background)

Red (#FF3B30)

Orange (#FF9500)

Yellow (#FFD60A)

Lime Green (#34C759)

Teal (#00796B)

Blue (#0A84FF)

Indigo (#5856D6)

Purple (#AF52DE)

Magenta (#FF2D55)

✨ Gradient examples we’ll use:

Linear: linear-gradient(90deg, #FF9500, #0A84FF, #AF52DE)

Hover animations that change hue smoothly.

⚙️ TECH STACK PLAN (You don’t need to code manually)

We’ll make it through Replit Agent 3 in small pieces.
Here’s how it’ll be structured:

Feature	Implementation
Framework	React + Vite + TailwindCSS
Animation	Framer Motion + AOS (Animate On Scroll)
AI Assistant	Gemini API (through Google SDK)
Icons	Lucide-react / Heroicons
Color Control	Tailwind Gradients + Custom CSS
Hosting	Start on Replit, later move to Render/Netlify (Free)
🧠 AI ASSISTANT (Gemini Integration)

This will be the main attraction.

Features:

Floating AI button (“Ask DTD AI”)

Popup chat (built with React modal + typing animation)

Multiple-choice start:

What’s your last qualification?

What’s your interest?

Do you prefer job, freelancing, or business?

Do you know computers?

Gemini API takes answers → returns recommended DEEP, KYP, or ADCA courses with links.

Animation:

AI icon pulsates softly

Modal slides in with blur background

Each message appears with typing dots → fade in

AI answer shows colored text highlights (like “DEEP – Digital Marketing” in bold blue)
